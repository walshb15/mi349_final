        <h1>About The Site of Babble</h1>
        <p>The Site of Babble was created with the sole purpose of providing a simple way of
            teaching people the vocab of new langagues in the simplest
            way possible. Many other language learning websites ask a lot of their users,
            and have features than can overcomplicate the learning experience.
            Getting twelve notifications about how you're not working hard enough to learn
            a language is something that turns a lot of people off from trying at all, 
            especially if you were only trying to casually study the language.
            The Site of Babble seeks to provide an alternative, simpler, and less stressful way
            of learning a new language.
        </p>
        <p>The Site of Babble does not require a microphone, headphones, an account, or anything else like that.
            It's just you and the vocab of the language you want to learn. It's something you can use leisurely
            without having to worry about getting spammed by countless emails about your progress, or getting punished
            for ending in the middle of a lesson set because you only wanted to study for a few minutes. Here, you can
            just sit down and learn, anytime, anywhere.
        </p>
        <p>The title "The Site of Babble" is inspired by the story of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel">Tower of Babel</a>.</p>

                <p>My name is Brendan Walsh, and I am the author of this site.
                    As of writing, I am currently a senior at Michigan State University
                    studying computer science. I was inspired to make this website from
                    my experiences in Italy when I studied abroad during the summer of 2019.
                    It was my first time leaving the United States, and was a fantastic experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One part of the journey that had me worried before I even left the USA
                    was that I would be going to a place with an entirely different language.
                    I was concerned that I wouldn't be able to get around with just English.
                    To solve this issue, I tried my best to learn how to speak Italian in the
                    few months I had before my trip began. I downloaded many apps and spent a
                    lot of time trying to learn as much as I could. One thing that I found out
                    though is that a lot of these apps weren't exactly the most convenient way of learning
                    a new language. The apps all required stuff like speaking into the microphone
                    or listening to spoken dialogue in the language you're trying to learn. These
                    features are actually quite helpful and nice to have, but at the same time,
                    they were somewhat limiting. I'd never be able to feel comfortable trying to
                    speak Italian into my phone in a public place like on a bus, and I'd never
                    want to have to listen to dialogue in another language when I'm just casually
                    trying to learn while hanging out on my friend's couch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another thing I always found quite bothersome about a lot of these language
                    learning apps is that they give the information to you in the form of lesson
                    sets or quizzes. This was a bit annoying if you only wanted to get a quick minute
                    or who of studying in, as it's unappealing to have to quit in the middle of a lesson.
                    Annoyances such as those are why I came up with The Site of Babble.
