# Site of Babble

This website was created for my MI349 final. It is meant to be a website you can go to in order to learn the vocab of other languages.

The preproduction documentation is contained within the file "PreProductionDocument.pdf"

One thing I learned while working on this project is that you can dynamically create HTML elements with JavaScript, and append them to the page.
